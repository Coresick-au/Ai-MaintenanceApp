## Executive Summary
Ai-MaintenanceApp is a **Hybrid Web/Desktop Application** designed for asset maintenance and inventory management. It utilizes a **React 19** frontend wrapped in **Electron** for desktop capabilities, backed by **Firebase** for real-time data and authentication.

The application follows a **Monolith** repository structure but is architected with a clear separation of concerns using the **Service-Repository Pattern** to manage Firestore interactions.
